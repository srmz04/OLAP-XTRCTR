Create a comprehensive summary of our entire conversation that will serve as complete context for continuing this work. Structure your summary to capture both the narrative flow and technical details necessary for seamless continuation.

Your summary must include these sections in order:

## 1. User's Primary Goals and Intent
Capture ALL explicit requests and objectives stated by the user throughout the conversation, preserving their exact priorities and constraints.

## 2. Conversation Timeline and Progress
Chronologically document the key phases of our work:
- Initial requests and how they were addressed
- Major decisions made and their rationale
- Problems encountered and solutions applied
- Current state of the work

## 3. Technical Context and Decisions
- Technologies, frameworks, and tools being used
- Architectural patterns and design decisions made
- Key technical constraints or requirements identified
- Important code patterns or conventions established

## 4. Files and Code Changes
For each file created, modified, or examined:
- Full file path/name
- Purpose and importance of the file
- Specific changes made (with key code snippets where critical)
- Current state of the file

## 5. Active Work and Last Actions
CRITICAL: Detail EXACTLY what was being worked on in the most recent exchanges:
- The specific task or problem being addressed
- Last completed action
- Any partial work or mid-implementation state
- Include relevant code snippets from the most recent work

## 6. Unresolved Issues and Pending Tasks
- Any errors or issues still requiring attention
- Tasks explicitly requested but not yet started
- Decisions waiting for user input

## 7. Immediate Next Step
State the SPECIFIC next action to take based on:
- The user's most recent request
- The current state of implementation
- Any ongoing work that was interrupted

Important: Be precise with technical details, file names, and code. The next agent reading this should be able to continue exactly where we left off without asking clarifying questions. Include enough detail that no context is lost, but remain focused on actionable information.

Respond with ONLY the summary text following this structure - no additional commentary or meta-discussion.
